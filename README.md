# CollectionsExamples
1st Collections Example Commit

Here I created a CollectionsExamples project via Spring Boot ToolSuit 4 and deployed it to GitHub.
We take a quick dive on a few Cllections principals, we create an ArrayList.java class to create 2 ArrayLists.
  *1st ArrayList is 'integerList', we play around with the size() method and get elements from the ArrayList by 
    selecting the index position.
  *2nd ArrayList is 'customerList', where we create Customer object type isntances from the Customer.java class, and 
    add them to customerList.
    We manipulate the index where a Customer is deployed to in the customerList, and we prnt all values of the list with 
    a for-each loop.
